Description: Estimation of an S-shaped function and its corresponding inflection point via a least squares approach. A sequential mixed primal-dual bases algorithm is implemented for the fast computation of the estimator. The same algorithm can also be used to solve other shape-restricted regression problems, such as convex regression. For more details, see the PhD thesis of Feng (2021) <https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~oyf20/Thesis-oyf20-final.pdf>.
